## ‚úÖ **Bonus Practice Ideas**

1. Add **computed balance update** after each transaction.
2. Create **aggregate query** to show total deposits per branch.
3. Add **loan interest calculation** using Mongoose virtuals.
4. Use `.populate()` to fetch related data (like customer info inside account).
5. Add query parameters like `/transactions?type=Deposit&limit=5&sort=-date`
